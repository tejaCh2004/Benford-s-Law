## How to import the code into the vscode editor:

1. Clone the folder from the git repository
2. Open vscode
3. Go to file (top left) and open workspace
4. Select "bendfordworkspace.code-workspace" and open it
VSCode will load it immediately. If you don't see it, expand the explorer (the file symbol on the left column)
